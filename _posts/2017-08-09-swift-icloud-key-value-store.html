The iCloud key-value storage is like the <code>UserDefaults</code> but synced across devices. It also survives uninstalls of the app. I used it today to add iCloud backups to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emoji-diary-daily-journal-with-emoticons/id1247061044?mt=8">Emoji Diary</a>. It required 4 lines of code.

<h3>Activate the iCloud capability</h3>

<p>Select your project in Xcode and then select the target under "Project and Targets". Activate iCloud and check "Key-Value storage".</p>

<h3>Add iCloud to your App ID</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/#/welcome">https://developer.apple.com/account/</a> -> Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles</li>
    <li>Under <strong>Identifiers -> App IDs</strong>, edit your App ID and <strong>check the iCloud box</strong>. For Key-Value storage "Compatible with Xcode 5" suffices. CloudKit is for documents, large files and Core Data. Click Done.</li>
    <li>Go to your <strong>Provisioning Profiles</strong>. You will see that they turned invalid. For each of them, click edit and then generate to regenerate them. By opening the downloaded Provisioning Profiles, Xcode will automatically update them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4 lines of code</h3>

<p>Wherever you need to access the key-value store, call</p>

<pre>
    <code>var keyStore = NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore()</code>
</pre>

<p>Add data just like with the <code>UserDefaults</code>:</p>

<pre>
    <code>keyStore.set("John Appleseed", forKey: "userName")</code>
</pre>

<p>Retrieve data somewhere else with:</p>

<pre>
    <code>let storedUserName = keyStore.string(forKey: "userName")</code>
</pre>

<p>So far, the keyStore acts like the <code>UserDefaults</code>. The data will be stored locally. To sync them with iCloud, call</p>

<pre>
    <code>keyStore.synchronize()</code>
</pre>

<p>This may not synchronize immediately but at "an appropriate later time" as the Apple Docs put it.</p>
