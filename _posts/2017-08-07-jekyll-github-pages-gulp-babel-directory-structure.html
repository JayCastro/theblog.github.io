<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></strong> is the most popular static site generator.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></strong> hosts your jekyll sites for free under *.github.io.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a></strong> lets you automate your build process (minifying .css files, concatenating all .js files etc.).</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">Babel</a></strong> lets you write ES6 <i>(cool new JavaScript)</i> even though not all browsers support it by transpiling it into ES5 <i>(lame old JavaScript)</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I switched to using Jekyll for this blog yesterday and I love it. There are blog posts describing how to combine a subset of the above, but I could not find one for combining all four. However, each of these four components brings its own peculiarities to consider, so no blog post worked out of the box. Here is the solution that I ended up with:</p>

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/batzner/github-pages-boilerplate/" target="_blank">boilerplate repository</a> for GitHub Pages with Gulp and Babel set up.</p>

<h5>Usage</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Fork the repo</li>
    <li>Run <code>npm install</code> in the root directory to install Gulp and Babel locally.</li>
    <li>Run <code>gulp jekyll</code> to build the site with Babel and serve it with Jekyll afterwards. Visit <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank">http://localhost:4000</a> to see the blog.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Development</h5>
<p>The <code>master</code> branch should only be used for deploying (see considerations below). For development, switch to the <code>dev</code> branch. After implementing your changes, test them by running <code>gulp jekyll</code> and visiting <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank">http://localhost:4000</a>.</p>

<p>If you are happy, checkout the <code>master</code> branch, merge the <code>dev</code> branch, run <code>gulp</code> to build the site into the project's root directory and push / deploy the new build to the <code>master</code> branch on GitHub.</p>

<p>Note: You can skip Babel during development by changing <code>source: _dist</code> to <code>source: src</code> and running <code>jekyll serve</code> in the root directory.</p>

<h5>Directory Structure</h5>

<p>See the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">Jekyll docs</a> for an explanation of the files and directories.</p>

<p>On <code>master</code></p>

<pre>
<code>
.
├── _layouts  // built by gulp
├── _posts  // built by gulp
├── js  // built by gulp
|   ├── main.js // transpiled by Babel
├── index.html  // built by gulp
├── src
|   ├── _layouts
|   ├── _posts

</pre>

<p>On <code>dev</code></p>

<code>

</pre>

<h3>Considerations</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Running Babel for transpiling the ES6 files into ES5 before each deployment of the site is not practical, so a build tool like Gulp that runs Babel automatically is a must.</li>
    <li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/babel/jekyll-babel" target="_blank">jekyll-babel Jekyll plugin</a> but you have to start each .js file with exactly
        <pre><code>---<br>---</code></pre>
        WebStorm does not like that and formats it wrongly every time. If you try to escape that block with <code>// @formatter:off</code>, the Jekyll plugin won't work anymore. Also, it is a bit dirty to mess with the .js files. If I want to directly run them during development, they will error. So, Babel has to be called by Gulp.
    </li>
    <li>Babel will generate the transpiled .js files somewhere. I don't want these files to mingle with the actual source .js files - that would cause confusion. So, using a <code>src</code> and a <code>_dist</code> directory (ignored by git) would be clean. Jekyll can then generate the static site in <code>_site</code> by using the files in <code>_dist</code>.</li>
    <li>You have to commit all files that Jekyll needs to the <code>master</code> branch on GitHub. So <code>_dist</code> must not be ignored by git. At the same time it is generated code so it should be ignored. A solution is to ignore <code>_dist</code> on the <code>dev</code> branch. Then, merge the <code>dev</code> branch to the <code>master</code> branch, run Gulp and push the new <code>_dist</code> to the GitHub <code>master</code> branch.</li>
    <li>For running Jekyll on the <code>_dist</code> directory, you would have to specify <code>source: _dist</code> in Jekyll's <code>_config.yml</code>. However, GitHub overrides the <code>source</code> setting, which you cannot change (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-jekyll/#configuration-settings-you-cannot-change" target="_blank">GitHub docs</a>). So Jekyll's source directory <strong>has to be the repo's top level directory</strong> (for username.github.io pages). You also <strong>must</strong> commit the page to the <code>master</code> branch. The solution is to keep the <code>source: _dist</code> setting for the <code>dev</code> branch, but let gulp build the site into the root directory on the <code>master</code> branch (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/" target="_blank">docs</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drawbacks</h3>

<ul>
    <li>On <code>master</code>, Gulp cannot clean the build directory before building because it is the project's root directory.</li>
    <li>You have to go to <code>master</code>, build and push for every deployment of the site. <a href="https://github.com/shinnn/gulp-gh-pages">The <code>gulp-gh-pages</code> gulp plugin</a> might help with that.</li>
    <li>On <code>master</code>, I had to change <code>_config.yml</code> and <code>gulpfile.js</code> to make Gulp build into the root directory. Thus, changes to these files in <code>dev</code> will have to be merged manually with master.</li>
</ul>
