title: Building a Neural Network from scratch
category: neural-network
introduction: "<p>In this series, we will build a neural network from scratch. The posts require no understanding at all of the subject, we will start from zero. At the end, we will have implemented a basic neural network that can recognize handwritten digits with 97% accuracy.</p>

<p>To get there, we will start with a much simpler dataset and then expand incrementally. On the way to digit recognition, I will explain the parts of a neural network in great detail.</p>
